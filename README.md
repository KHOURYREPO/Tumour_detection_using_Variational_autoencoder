* Tools used in the project

  ## Dataset
The dataset is a popular dataset from a Kaggle challenge to detect tumors in brain MRI scans. From the dataset folder are 2 sets of datasets 

*NO - no tumor
*YES - tumor

## Tools used in the project
* The project is programmed using Python with Pytorch as the selected tool for the deep learning
